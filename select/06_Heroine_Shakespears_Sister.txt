Oh baby the freezing cold
Oh baby the dead of night
Oh baby the blue blue flowers
Oh baby in the midnight hour

I'll be your heroine
If they come knocking
I won't let them in
I'll be your heroine heroine

Oh baby just in time
Well maybe the night is mine
Oh baby don't forget
I'll save you it's not over yet

If you're feeling sick and it starts to rain
When you're in a fix I'll ease your pain

I'll be your heroine
If they come knocking
I won't let them in
I'll be your heroine heroine

Oh baby the telephone
Oh baby the devil's smile
Oh baby you're not alone
Don't worry I'll stay a while

I can hold your hand when the night is dark
In this foreign land I'm your Joan of Arc

I'll be your heroine
If they come knocking
I won't let them in
I'll be your heroine heroine

I'm your heroine
And if they come knocking
I won't let them in
I'm your heroine
