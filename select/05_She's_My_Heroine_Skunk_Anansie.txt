I can't weep, only cry
I can move, I deny
See my smile, eat, eat, eat
Fe, fe, feed you, so damn sweet
She's calling, she's calling

She's my heroine
She's my heroine
Fingers going down, down
She's my heroine

You're too weird
Creep, creep, creep
Smiley faces so discrete
La, la, lover, evil eyes
I can't sleep for her lies
She's calling, she's crawling

She's my heroine
She's my heroine
Fingers going down, down
She's my heroine

Smashed you in the face
Up against the wall
Still your secret's safe
There's no one I can call

She's my heroine
She's my heroine
She's my heroine
She's my heroine

She's my heroine
She's my heroine
She's my heroine
She's my heroine
